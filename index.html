                <p>In the 1980s, the Bhopal region experienced one of the
                    worst industrial disasters of release of toxic chemicals
                    from the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) pesticide
                    plant. The catastrophe raised awareness about
                    industrial pollution. The water quality of the lakes in
                    Bhopal has been significantly impacted by the 1984
                    gas tragedy.
                    In the years that followed, the Bhopal region dealt with
                    environmental challenges,
                    particularly regarding water quality. Therefore, we plan
                    to check what are the impacts of this Gas Tragedy
                    using GIS Technique and Satellite Imagery. </p>

                <p>Current practices of performing road inspections
                    are time-consuming and labour-intensive. Road
                    surfaces degrade on a daily basis as a result of the
                    heavy traffic on them. This will not only impact the
                    driverâ€™s comfort but will also impact economic
                    efficiency. To maintain roads as efficiently as
                    possible, municipalities perform regular
                    inspections.</p>
